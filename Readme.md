cubature
========

Updated this package in two ways:

- Now using  `Rcpp` (as of version 1.2)
- Synced up to newer version of
  [cubature](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Cubature) library
  (version 1.0.2) by Steven Johnson (now done, for `hcubature`, but
  `pcubature` remains)
- Added vectorized interface to `hcubature`
