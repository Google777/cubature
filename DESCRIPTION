Description: R wrapper around the cubature C library of
    Steven G. Johnson for adaptive multivariate integration over hypercubes.
    Due to the size of the header file in the underlying C library, the build
    process downloads the library from github (https://github.com/bnaras/cubature-1.0.2)
    during the build process.
